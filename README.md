## Title

It's a never ending incremental game, infinite if you will.

## Game
A big fan of incremental games like Universal Paperclips and Kittens game I wanted to build my own. My main problem when thinking about doing it is that those are very impressive narrative exercises and I was stuck for a plot based idea. My cunning way round this was to  leave that up to the player.
